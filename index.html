        <div class="subheading mb-5">Basketball Trainer</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a basketball trainer. I have been playing basketball since I was 5 years old. I have always loved the game and loved getting better. I played in college and in professional leagues overseas for many years. I am now 40 years old and just retired after my great career. It has been a struggle and my body has been through a lot, but after plenty of hard work, I eventually pushed through and was successful in the game. My goal is to show kids how much work it takes and what skills they need to add to their game to become a pro. It isn't easy. It will take plenty of hardwork and determination to achieve your goals and dreams.   <br><br>

        I am a big fan of Lebron James, Giannis, and Zion Williamson. I try to model my game after theirs. Whoever a kid wants to play like or be, I will train them hard enough to see if they have what it takes to become that player. Basketball is an art form and people no matter what need to do whatever it takes to succeed and win. I love basketball. The game provides us with joy, and so many fun activities to have a great life. I have trained many players like Lebron James, Giannis, Zion, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry and more. I have been doing this my whole life and I am very passionate about the game of basketball. It is all I have ever loved. The thing I love about basketball is when you dribble the basketball, it comes up right back to you. I love it. I want to continue to train kids to become great basketball players for the rest of my life. I will do whatever it takes to make your kid the greatest basketball player of all time. I have a lot of gear and tips and drills to make you great at basketball. If you trust my advice, I promise you will be a great basketball player through time and hard work.That is the goal.<br><br>

         I hate giving up. It is not part of my personality. I will always strive to make your son or daughter or even you as good as possible. I grew up in a big family, so there was not a bunch of love to go around. I had to fight for everything and most of the time, I felt left out. SO I would go outside and dribble and shoot the basketball all day long. I would shoot day till night. I would dribble day to night. I would sometimes wake up at 6 in the morning and then go back inside at 2 in the morning. That is how much I wanted to be good at basketball. That was my goal. With my help, you can do the same, and become one of the greatest to ever play the game of basketball. So if you want this, join my training program as soon as possible to become the best ever!
